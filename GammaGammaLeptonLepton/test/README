Code:
	GammaGammaLeptonLepton contains analysis code for gamma gamma -> l+ l- and gamma p -> Upsilon -> l+ l- 
	analyses. The code is in DiffractiveForwardAnalysis/GammaGammaLeptonLepton 
	(http://cmssw.cvs.cern.ch/cgi-bin/cmssw.cgi/CMSSW/DiffractiveForwardAnalysis/GammaGammaLeptonLepton/)

	The output is flat ntuples containing arrays of candidates. There are four modules, where each one 
	has a .cc, .h, and .cfi file:

		GammaGammaMuMu		for running on reconstructed dimuon events 
		GammaGammaEE		for running on reconstructed dielectron events
		GammaGammaMuMuMC	for running on generator-level (genParticleCandidates) dimuon events
		GammaGammaEEMC		for running on generator-level (genParticleCandidates) dielectron events

	The main file for running the ntuple maker is test/RunGammaGammaLeptonLepton.cfg.

How to run:
	The code will dump out all events that have exactly two opposite sign leptons
	from the selected lists that pass the selected dpt and dphi cuts. To run it, edit 
	the main RunGammaGammaLeptonLepton.cfg file:

		1) Edit the PoolSource to choose your input files

		2) Edit the "path p" at the end to choose which of the 4 analysis modules will run.

		3) Modify the parameter values from the defualt values set in the cfi's (as needed).

		   For the modules that run on reco'd data, you can choose the input RECO/AOD lists, 
		   the dpt and dphi cuts on the lepton pair, the deltaR from the leptons used 
		   for the extra towers in the exclusivity, and the output ntuple file name. 
	
		   For the modules that run on gen-level data, the only choices are the output 
		   file name and whether to dump out all particles in the event, or only the
		   interesting ones (leptons + forward protons)

		4) cmsRun RunGammaGammaLeptonLepton.cfg

	Note: There is als commented-out code in GammaGammaMuMu.cc and GammaGammaEE.cc for retrieving 
	event-by-event weights from mixed samples (like the CSA07 soups). If it is uncommented and recompiled,
	the event weights will be retrieved if the CSA07EventWeightProducer module declared in the 
	RunGammaGammaLeptonLepton.cfg is added to the path.

	There are several ROOT macros in the test/ directory for doing further analysis 
	and making plots from the output ntuples:

			PlotSigVsBkg.C 		applies the exclusivity and lepton cuts and makes 
				       		the plots used for the CSA07 PAS analysis. 

			MakeWeightedPlots.C 	makes histograms of the CSA07 soup samples, after 
				            	applying the appropriate event-by-event weights. 

			MakeSkimQAPlots.C 	just makes a page of plots of the main analysis 
						variables. 
	
			DileptonFitter.C 	RooFit macro for fitting the Upsilon mass region.
